### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, a Computer Science student from the West Midlands, United Kingdom. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

My main interests lie in Machine Learning and its utility to problems in the natural sciences. I am currently:

- An undergraduate at the [Dept. of Computer Science, University of Warwick](https://dcs.warwick.ac.uk).
- Vice President of the [Warwick Artificial Intelligence](https://warwick.ai/) society.
- Lead Organiser of the [Warwick Hackathon](https://warwickhack.co.uk/).
- An [undergraduate researcher](https://warwick.ac.uk/urss/) of algorithmic Reinforcement Learning improvements, and their applications to fine-tuning LLMs.
- Contributor to cool [open-source projects in my free time](https://github.com/stmio/), such as PufferLib.
